⚠️  AUTO-MANAGED BY SMITH SYNC SYSTEM

This directory is automatically managed by smith-sync.sh
https://github.com/elkraneo/Smith

DO NOT:
- Edit files directly in this directory
- Delete or rename files
- Move this directory
- Commit changes to Smith/ files (they'll be overwritten)

IF YOU NEED:
- To customize patterns: Edit CLAUDE.md (root level, project-specific)
- To link patterns: Read SMITH-FRAMEWORK-ESSENTIALS.md
- To modify framework: Submit to Smith via DISCOVERY-SUBMISSION-TEMPLATE.md

HOW THIS WORKS:
1. Run: /path/to/Smith/Scripts/smith-sync.sh .
2. Framework updates automatically (SOURCE OF TRUTH: Smith repo)
3. CLAUDE.md merges intelligently if you customized it
4. Other Smith/ files overwrite (fresh from Smith)

SYNC COMMAND:
  /path/to/Smith/Scripts/smith-sync.sh /path/to/this/project

LAST SYNCED:
  See ../.smith-sync-manifest.json for version + timestamp
