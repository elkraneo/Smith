# Auto-detection patterns - Claude loads this skill when these are detected
triggers:
  # Primary TCA patterns
  - "ComposableArchitecture"
  - "TCA reducer"
  - "@Reducer"
  - "@ObservableState"
  - "@Shared"
  - "WithViewStore"
  - "@Bindable"
  - "ViewStore"

  # Swift patterns that benefit from Smith
  - "SwiftUI navigation"
  - ".sheet"
  - ".scope"
  - "State management"
  - "Dependency injection"
  - "@DependencyClient"

  # Problem indicators
  - "reducer not compiling"
  - "action not received"
  - "TCA error"
  - "child features"

  # File patterns
  - "*Feature.swift"
  - "*Reducer.swift"
  - "import ComposableArchitecture"
